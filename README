Ushahidi Swiftriver 0.0.1
==========================
 
Swiftriver is a FOSS platform for determining the veracity and and accuracy of news during a crisis. There's a global emergency. Twitter, blogs and the news are all ablaze with rumor and reports.  Swiftriver's role is to surface information based on relevancy using probabilistic algorithms and crowd-sourcing.  The system has a dual function, to help Ushahidi 'sweep' through and find only relevant content (avoiding duplicates and chatter), while also offering the public and casual users a way to identify relevant sources of news on any given subject.
 
It is currently being built as a scalable sister platform to Ushahidi like our other project SMS Turks.  We are also incorporating various modules and APIs that power complex components like the predictive tagging and deductive location features.

OTHER COMPONENTS
===================
 
Swift is being constructed with a distributed architecture to spread load across servers.  There are two other components of the system that can also be found on GitHub. Swift User Location Services App (SULSa) and Swift Language Computation Core (SiLCC).
