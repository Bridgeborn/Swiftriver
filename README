Ushahidi Swiftriver 0.0.2
==========================
 
Swiftriver is a FOSS platform for determining the veracity and and accuracy of news during a crisis. There's a global emergency. Twitter, blogs and the news are all ablaze with rumor and reports.  Swiftriver's role is to surface relevant information using probabilistic algorithms and crowd-sourcing. 
 
It is currently being built as a scalable sister platform to Ushahidi like our other project SMS Turks.  We are also incorporating various modules and APIs that power complex components like the predictive tagging and deductive location features.
